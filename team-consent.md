Hi Haig!

It seems as though we're partners for the final project assignment, and I'm excited to work together! 

I was thinking we should try to meet up in the near future to discuss ideas for the next assignment.

Let me know if anytime this weekend or early next week works for you.

Here's my extended contact info, feel free to contact me however and whenever!
